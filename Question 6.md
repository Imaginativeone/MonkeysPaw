Question 6
An overall insight of the story is if you are asked "If you could have anything in the world,
what would it be?", and you do not know what to say, then don't risk trying to make life
better by using things like curses, or in this case, the monkey's paw.

On the one hand, I might say that the family's use of the paw's wishes was fate. The paw may
have forced them to make the wishes with its magic. In the story, we read this: 
"It had a spell put on it by an old fakir," said the sergeant-major, "a very holy man. 
He wanted to show that fate ruled people's lives, and that those who interfered with it 
did so to their sorrow."


On the other hand, the use of the wishes might be thought of as free will. The fakir's
power might be superstition! I asked my Dad "What would you do with the paw? What wishes 
would you make?" His reply was that he would not make any wishes, especially if we knew 
its dangerous history. Like my Dad, a person might choose to avoid the paw. As a matter of
fact, "Morris said the things happened so naturally," said his father, "that you might if 
you so wished attribute it to coincidence." It is very likely the events in this story
ARE coincidences, and the characters are just dumb.
